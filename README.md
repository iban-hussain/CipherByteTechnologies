# Iris-Flower-Classification-using-ML

The Iris Flower Classification project is a foundational exercise in data science and machine learning. It involves classifying iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their sepals and petals.

## Overview

**Objective**: Classify iris flowers into:
1. **Iris setosa**
2. **Iris versicolor**
3. **Iris virginica**

**Dataset**: The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with four features for each sample:
1. Sepal length
2. Sepal width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width

## Steps and Considerations

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Obtain the dataset from repositories like the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Load data into an analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Examine dataset structure.
   - Use descriptive statistics and visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) to understand data distribution and relationships.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Standardize/normalize data if necessary.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks.
   - Use libraries like Scikit-Learn for implementation.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Train models on the training set.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
   - Compare model performance.

7. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best model for predictions.
   - Build a user interface or API for accessibility.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
